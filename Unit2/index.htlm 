	<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by? Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
	<p><a href="http://erikjohanssonphoto.com"http://erikjohanssonphoto.com </a>and <a href="http://www.apple.com"http://www.apple.com</a></p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>At Erik Johansson’s site, he uses smaller positive space with larger negative white space surrounds. Therefore, our eyes will immediately pay attention at the focal point, which is the big photo sideshow. The photo sides are placed in the center of the whole site.<br>At Apple’s site, they also use a lot of negative white space. The objects are placed balance in the middle of the site.</br>
	<h3>What makes them similar and different?</h3>
	<p>Both of the sites are kind of similar since they all used a lot of negative space against positive space. They also put their focal point at the center of the page to draw attention.However, I think Apple uses much more negative space</p>
